Proxying download requests to DropBox, Google Drive and OneDrive even if the proxy is blocking these

There are situations where you don't want your users to connect to DropBox etc. (Informationleakage)
But if you want to download public files (from a conference talk or such things) you cant do so. This is where 
this little proxy tries to jump in.

It is still WiP though.
